From 2013 to 2017 I was a NERC-sponsored PhD student at the University of Manchester, UK. My research developed land surface flooding and erosion modelling software so that it could be integrated with more realistic rainfall inputs such as rainfall radar data, and numerical weather prediction model output. My project involved porting and optimising a numerical model to an HPC (High-performance computing) system. With these improved models, we can better investigate how natural landscapes respond to the severe storms. Specifically I investigated how hydrodynamic models of river catchments are sensitive to the spatial variability of rainfall input data, compared to other uncertainties such as gemorphological change during flood events. I focused on case studies of UK flooding from intense rainfall events. 

My thesis was titled: _Numerical modelling of river catchment hydro-geomorphological sensitivity to spatial variability in rainfall._
