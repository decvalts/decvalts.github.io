Hello! This blog is mainly for my notes about writing code, software design and so on. Occasionally I might post more wordy blogposts on other topics.

I'm a software engineer, currently working at the Met Office (UK), where I work on developing [software for configuring and running climate research models and weather forecasting systems](http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/weather/weather-science-it/modelling-support). I'm interested in general in designing and writing software for scientific applications, as well as porting and optimising it for high-performance computing systems.

Previously I was a PhD candidate at the University of Manchester developing numerical models to study how different patterns of rainfall drive land surface erosion and landscape evolution. My slighlty-more-official academic/research webpage is [over here.](http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/declan.valters/)  Don't worry, it links back to here where all the juicy programming stuff is...

This website is based on the [Freshmen21 theme](https://http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/freshman21/) by [Lijia Yu](http://yulijia.net/).
