I'm a software engineer interested in designing and developing scientific applications, particularly for geosciences (hydrology, atmospheric science, geomorphology) and high-performance computing. Technologies that I'm interested in include C++, Fortran, Python, MPI, OpenMP, and Linux operating systems.

I currently work at the Met Office (UK), where I work on developing [software for configuring and running climate research models and weather forecasting systems](http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/weather/weather-science-it/modelling-support). I'm interested in general in designing and writing software for scientific applications, as well as porting and optimising it for high-performance computing systems.

Previously, I did a PhD at the University of Manchester developing numerical models to study how different patterns of rainfall drive land surface erosion and landscape evolution. My slighlty-more-official academic/research webpage is [over here](http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/declan.valters/). Thesis: _Modelling catchment sensitivity to rainfall resolution and erosional parameterisation in simulations of flash floods in the UK._
