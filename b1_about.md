I'm a software engineer interested in designing and developing scientific applications, particularly for geosciences (hydrology, atmospheric science, geomorphology) and porting and optimising these applications for high-performance computing systems. Technologies that I'm interested in include Fortran, C++, Python, MPI, OpenMP, and Linux operating systems.

Previously I worked at the Met Office (UK), where I worked on developing [software for configuring and running workflows required for climate research and weather forecasting systems](http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/weather/weather-science-it/modelling-support).

I completed a PhD at the University of Manchester developing flood-inundation models (based on LISFLOOD) to investigate how they are sensitive to the choice of erosional process parametersiation and spatial resolution of rainfal data input. The spin-off model I developed ([HAIL-CAESAR](http://dvalts.io/HAIL-CAESAR/)) was parallelised and ported to the ARCHER HPC service to carry out sensitivity analyses using ensemble simulations. My thesis was titled: _Modelling catchment sensitivity to rainfall resolution and erosional parameterisation in simulations of flash floods in the UK._
