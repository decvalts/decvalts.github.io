# Python: The programming language for geoscience

## Why Python at all?

Python is a programming lanaguage, a tool to get computers to do things for us quickly in a systematic and (hopefully) reproducible way. Not only is Python a programming language, but a community of people writing software to solve shared problems. There is no cost to using Python other than having access to a computer and possibly an internet connection from time to time. 

Two terms used to describe the python programming language are '__high-level__' and '__general-purpose__'. (A frequently used third term is that it is _interpreted_ as well, but we will come to that later). These are rather abstract terms used a lot when describing programming languages, but they are attractive concepts, particularly to scientists and those working with scientists.

### High level

Python is designed to help the programmer (or non-programmer) write code quickly to solve problems. To achieve this, Python 'abstracts away' (deals with automatically) things more closely related to the computer's internals, like it's memory, operating system, or processor. Other languages, such as Fortran, C, C++ require a deeper undestanding of computers to be used to their full potential. (Technically, these are also 'high-level' languages as well, but you could think of Python being _more_ high-level than these languages.
